Key Insights into AHDLA and SLPM Algorithm Comparison:

**Early Performance Advantages:**

- Both algorithms display a rising performance trend with increasing bids, effectively utilizing accepted ones.
- AHDLA initially exhibits a slightly higher performance, indicating its ability to capitalize on early bids and more frequently updated dual prices
 effectively.

**Later Stage Performance Convergence:**

- AHDLA maintains a slight performance advantage at later stages, potentially attributed to its dynamic decision updates.

**Algorithm Divergence:**

- AHDLA dynamically adjusts decision-making based on action history, potentially leading to better responsiveness to changing bid quality.
- SLPM relies on a static decision rule based on a subset of bids, resulting in less adaptability to evolving bid patterns.


Overall Observations: Both algorithms demonstrate strong performance in terms of revenue generation and value capture compared to the optimal solution. Selecting between them depends on factors like:

1. Bid Environment Fluctuations: If bid quality fluctuates significantly over time, AHDLA's dynamic approach might be advantageous.
2. Computational Limitations: SLPM's simpler logic might be preferable in resource-constrained situations.
